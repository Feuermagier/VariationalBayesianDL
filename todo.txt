- Laplace
- MedMNIST, Retinopathy, WILDS
- Transfer CIFAR10 -> STL10
- Increasing #ensembles for vanilla vs RMS => RMS should profit more
- KL loss vs data loss for BBB for different temperatures
- MCD: Dropout after convolutions? Sensitivity to dropout rate?
- VOGN: Less MC samples sometimes better because noise explores parameter space better?
- Flipout?
- What do we want from a good posterior approximation?
